**Why invest time to assess your source code strategy?**

The assessment helps you to discover and exploit opportunities to...

- Increase business & customer value

- Reduce costs

- Increase quality

- Increase employee satisfaction

- Transform culture from silos to collaboration

Opportunities might be any combination of short-term, medium-term, long-term.

**What do we mean by source code?**

Any "codified" knowledge related to...

- Products, solutions, publications or services

- The full life-cycle of the above

- Examples:

  - Production application or service source code and configuration

  - Test automation source code and configuration

  - Product or service documentation (including for dev, ops or users)

  - Infrastructure, build, deployment and monitoring code and configuration

**Who can be assessed?**

- Groups from 2 people to thousands under the same criteria

- Assessment value is best with a cohesive group such as a business and
involving more than 20 people

- Assessment value increases if the assessed group is (or aspires to be)
part of a larger organization of groups and external eco-systems
