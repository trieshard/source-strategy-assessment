# Source Code Strategy Assessment Framework

## Assessment Outputs

- A "score" for your source code strategy

  - **E** Awareness: you know about source code strategies but do not have one yet

  - **D** - Initial: you take some ad hoc actions to exploit opportunities or
  limit weaknesses

  - **C** - Standard: you have a defined basic strategy and evidence of its
  consistent implementation

  - **B** - Advanced: you have an ambitious strategy, evidence of its
  implementation and continuous improvement

  - **A** - Differentiator: you are innovators or thought-leaders in source
  code strategy and supporting tools & techniques
  
  - **Note** - Scores higher than C also show evidence of influence beyond the
  group under assessment

- Suggestions for improvement

- Follow-up on specific topics (optional)

## Assessment Topics

- Inventory

- Consumption

- Contribution

- Ecosystems

## Glossary

- **Your/The Group** - the assessee group

- **Product** - product, solution or service

## Inventory - Sample Questions

- How would you find all source code touched by people in your group?

- How do you know nothing is missing from your inventory?

- How do you support intentionally private source code?

- How would you find source code by domain, technology or other categories?

- How do you use the above identified information?

- How do you map relationships between projects, repositories, products,
solutions, components, sub-systems, people, authors, teams, external repositories?

- How do you optimize the above identified relationships?

- What bulk measures or actions do you make across all source code?

- How do you know which code do you depend on that is not touched by
people in your group?

- How much of external code can you see or contribute to?

- How do you measure source code alignment with external initiatives or requirements?

- How easy is it to discover a topic of interest in your source code. For example,
by domain, tech stack or functionality)?

### Inventory - Sample Scoring

- **D** - With some effort you can get a partially complete
inventory source code and you have ad hoc discoverability techniques.

- **C** - Producing and managing a near complete inventory is possible.
You have examples of value added use of the inventory. You have implemented some
discovery techniques. You can produce a basic map of basic source code relationships.

- **B** - You have automated techniques to produce an inventory with a
low probability that anything is missing. You can show a versatile map of source
code relationships and useful discovery options backed by metadata or automated.
You have consistent examples of value added use of inventory to optimize, harmonize,
bulk analyze, bulk process or align with external initiatives.

- **A** - observability and discoverability is nearly fully automatic and
self-policing, other innovative techniques in measuring, connecting and
exploiting value from inventory and relationship data.

### Consumption - Sample Questions

- Do you know the number of people in your group are reading or
reusing source code touched by the group?

- Do you know the number of people in your group are reading or
reusing source code external to the group?

- Do you know what value people are getting from reading or re-using source
code?

- How do you maximize the value identified above?

- How do you measure and optimize black-box versus single-source vs
duplicate-source re-use strategies?

- How do you encourage consumption that you identify as valuable?

- How do you avoid duplication style re-use? Do you know how much of this type
of re-use you have?

- How do you measure consumption related to external initiatives or requirements?

- How does your and external inventory strategies affect your re-use results?

### Consumption - Example Scores

### Contribution - Example Questions

### Contribution - Example Scores

### Ecosystems - Example Questions

- What are your strategies for community, communications, publicity and contributor-experience?

- How do you discover commercial opportunities for your source code?

- How do you measure the success of the ecosystems that you want to develop?

- How are you measuring the "developer experience" of your source sharing or SDKs?
