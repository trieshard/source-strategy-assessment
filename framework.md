# Source Code Strategy Assessment Framework

## What do we mean by source code?

Any "codified" knowledge related to...

- A product, solution, publication or service 

- The full life-cycle of that product, solution or service

### Examples

- Production application or service source code and configuration

- Test automation source code and configuration

- Product or service documentation (including for dev, ops or users)

- Infrastructure, build, deployment and monitoring code and configuration

## Why assess your source code strategy?

To discover if you already have, or could have, source code strategies that exploit opportunities to increase business & customer value and/or reduce costs, increase employee satisfaction and help the whole organization to collaborate across silos.

Opportunities might be any combination of short-term, medium-term, long-term.



## What is the output of this assessment?

- A "score" for your source code strategy

- Advice and support on improvement areas (if you want it)

- Very high level description of scores...
    
    - *E* - Awareness: you know about source code strategy but do not have one yet
    
    - *D* - Ad hoc: you take some ad hoc actions to exploit opportunities and limit weaknesses
    
    - *C* - Standard: you have a defined basic strategy and evidence of its consistent implenentation
    
    - *B* - Advanced: you have an ambitious strategy, evidence of its implementation and continuous improvement
    
    - *A* - Differentiator: you are thought leaders and/or innovators in source code strategy

- Scores higher than C also show evidence of influence beyond the group under assessment

## What is the group under assessment?

- Internal or external business with their own P&L.

- Start assessment with questions to calibrate on "what is your business? - who are your customers?"

## What is covered by the assessment?

### Inventory & Observability

#### What sort of questions will we ask?

- Where is all the source code (created/changed by people in my business)?

- How "accessible" is it en mass? How do I know how accessible it is? How do I know what is hidden (accidentally or intentionally)? Do all people in my business have access to all source created/changed by anyone in the GUA?

- What value do I leverage from observability of all code (e.g., bulk comparisons)?

- What code do I depend on that is not created/changed by my people? Can I see it? What value can I get from seeing it?

- How do I measure alignment with wider corporate initatives or requirements?

- How do I visualize the multiple potentially many-to-many relationships between source code, projects, repositories, products, services and solutions? How expensive is it for someone to find this out? How do I optimize those relationships for added value or reduced cost?

- How easy is it to discover a topic of interest in my source code (e.g., from domain, from tech stack, from requirement)

#### What might each score look like in this category?

- Example D - some people can access some of the code some of the time. No full inventory. Ad hoc discoverability.
- Example C - policy wiki on where is source and minimal source code tagging with meta data for easier find. Exploits some group observability (e.g., de-duplication, tech stack analysis and harmonization)
- Example B - advanced polcy examples include... visualization of developer footprint spread... repository tech harmonization
- Example A - observability is automatic from when developer starts typing... self-policing 

### Consumption

- Do I know how many people inside or outside of my business either read or re-use source code that was created/changed by people in my business?

- Do I know the value that people are getting from reading or re-using this srouce code?

- How much do we read or re-use code that was not created by people in our business? How do we maximize value from that type of consumption?

- How do I encourage consumption (especially consumption that I identify as most valuable)?

- How well do we consume source code that aligns with corporate initiatives and enterprise architecture direction?

### Contribution



### Eco-Systems (community, communications, publicity, contributor-experience)

- Exploit all of the above for your business value?

- Are you leveraging research ecosystems via source-level SDKs?

- How are you creating developer pull for charged SDKs?
