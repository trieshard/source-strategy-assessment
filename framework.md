# Source Code Strategy Assessment Framework

**What is the output of this assessment?**

- A "score" for your source code strategy

- Advice and support on improvement areas (if you want it)

- Very high level description of scores...

  - **E** Awareness: you know about source code strategies but do not have one yet

  - **D** - Initial: you take some ad hoc actions to exploit opportunities and
  limit weaknesses

  - **C** - Standard: you have a defined basic strategy and evidence of its
  consistent implementation

  - **B** - Advanced: you have an ambitious strategy, evidence of its
  implementation and continuous improvement

  - **A** - Differentiator: you are thought leaders and/or innovators in source
  code strategy

  - Scores higher than C also show evidence of influence beyond the group under assessment

**What is covered by the assessment?**

- Inventory & Observability
- Consumption
- Contribution
- Ecosystems

**What do we mean by "group"?**

The group being assessed. Typically a business but could be any grouping.

## Inventory & Observability - Example Questions

- Where is all the source code (created/changed by people in the group)?

- How "accessible" is it en mass? How do you know how accessible it is?
How do you know what not visible (accidentally or intentionally)?
Do all people assessed have awareness or access to all source created/changed
by anyone in the group?

- What value do you leverage from observability of all code
(e.g., bulk comparisons and analytics bringing new insights)?

- What code do you depend on that is not created/changed by the group's people?
Can you see it? What value can you get from seeing it?

- How do you measure alignment with wider external initiatives or requirements?
For example coming from the group of groups - voluntary or mandatory.

- How do you visualize the multiple potentially many-to-many relationships
between source code, projects, repositories, products, services and solutions?
How expensive (time or cost) is it to find this out?
How do I optimize those relationships for added value or reduced cost?

- How easy is it to discover a topic of interest in my source code
(e.g., from domain, from tech stack, from requirement)?

### Inventory & Observability - Example Score Indications

- **D** - some people can access some of the code some of the time.
No full inventory. Ad hoc discoverability.

- **C** - policy on source inventory and some minimum required source code
tagging with meta data (or other technique) for easier find. Exploits some
group-level observability
(e.g., de-duplication, tech stack analysis and harmonization)

- **B** - ambitious policy on source inventory and discoverability,
good observability of relationships between source and non-source groupings
visualizations of developer footprint spread, repository tech harmonization,
evidence of continuous improvement of data collected and exploited

- **A** - observability and discoverability is nearly fully automatic and
self-policing, other innovative techniques in measuring, connecting and
exploiting value from inventory and observability

### Consumption - Example Questions

- Do you know how many people inside or outside of the group either read
or re-use source code that was created/changed by other people
in the group?

- Do you know the value that people are getting from reading or re-using source
code that they did not create? How do you measure and maximize that value?

- How do you optimize re-use towards black-box level (binary, service, etc.)
while also leveraging source level access?

- How do you encourage consumption
(especially consumption that I identify as most valuable)?

- How do you avoid duplication style re-use? Do you know how much of this type
of re-use you have?

- How well do we consume source code that aligns with corporate initiatives
and enterprise architecture direction?

### Consumption - Example Scores

### Contribution - Example Questions

### Contribution - Example Scores

### Ecosystems - Example Questions

- Includes community, communications, publicity, contributor-experience

- Exploit all of the above for your business value?

- Are you leveraging research ecosystems via source-level SDKs?

- How are you creating developer pull for charged SDKs?

### Ecosystems - Example Scores
