## Why assess your source code strategy

To discover if you already have, or could have, source code strategies that exploit opportunities to increase business & customer value and/or reduce costs, increase employee satisfaction and help the whole organization to collaborate across silos.

Opportunities might be any combination of short-term, medium-term, long-term.
