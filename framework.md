# Source Code Strategy Assessment Framework

**What is the output of this assessment?**

- A "score" for your source code strategy

- Advice and support on improvement areas (if you want it)

- Very high level description of scores...

  - **E** - Awareness: you know about source code strategy but do not have one yet

  - **D** - Ad hoc: you take some ad hoc actions to exploit opportunities and limit weaknesses

  - **C** - Standard: you have a defined basic strategy and evidence of its consistent implenentation

  - **B** - Advanced: you have an ambitious strategy, evidence of its implementation and continuous improvement

  - **A** - Differentiator: you are thought leaders and/or innovators in source code strategy

  - Scores higher than C also show evidence of influence beyond the group under assessment

**What is covered by the assessment?**

- Inventory & Observability
- Consumption
- Contribution
- Eco-Systems

**What do we mean by "group"?**

The group being assessed. Typically a business but could be any grouping.

## Inventory & Observability - Example Questions

- Where is all the source code (created/changed by people in the group)?

- How "accessible" is it en mass? How do I know how accessible it is?
How do I know what is hidden (accidentally or intentionally)?
Do all people assessed have access to all source created/changed
by anyone in the group?

- What value do I leverage from observability of all code
(e.g., bulk comparisons)?

- What code do I depend on that is not created/changed by the group's people?
Can I see it? What value can I get from seeing it?

- How do I measure alignment with wider corporate initatives or requirements?

- How do I visualize the multiple potentially many-to-many relationships
between source code, projects, repositories, products, services and solutions?
How expensive is it for someone to find this out?
How do I optimize those relationships for added value or reduced cost?

- How easy is it to discover a topic of interest in my source code
(e.g., from domain, from tech stack, from requirement)?

### Inventory & Observability - Example Score Indications

- **D** - some people can access some of the code some of the time.
No full inventory. Ad hoc discoverability.

- **C** - policy wiki on where is source and minimal source code
tagging with meta data for easier find. Exploits some group observability
(e.g., de-duplication, tech stack analysis and harmonization)

- **B** - advanced polcy examples include...
visualization of developer footprint spread...
repository tech harmonization

- **A** - observability is automatic from when developer starts typing...
self-policing

### Consumption - Example Questions

- Do I know how many people inside or outside of the group either read
or re-use source code that was created/changed by other people
in the group?

- Do I know the value that people are getting from reading or re-using
this srouce code? How do I measure and maximize that value?

- How much do we read or re-use code that was not created by people in the
group? How do we maximize value from that type of consumption?

- How do I encourage consumption (especially consumption that I identify
as most valuable)?

- How well do we consume source code that aligns with corporate initiatives
and enterprise architecture direction?

### Consumption - Example Scores

### Contribution - Example Questions

### Contribution - Example Scores

### Eco-Systems - Example Questions

- Includes community, communications, publicity, contributor-experience

- Exploit all of the above for your business value?

- Are you leveraging research ecosystems via source-level SDKs?

- How are you creating developer pull for charged SDKs?

### Eco-Systems - Example Scores
