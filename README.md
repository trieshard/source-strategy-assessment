# Source Code Strategy Assessment Framework

**Why invest time to assess your source code strategy?**

The assessment helps you to discover and exploit opportunities to...

- Increase business & customer value

- Reduce costs

- Increase quality

- Increase employee satisfaction

- Transform culture from silos to collaboration

Opportunities might be any combination of short-term, medium-term, long-term.

**What do we mean by source code?**

Any "codified" knowledge related to...

- Products, solutions, publications or services

- The full life-cycle of the above

- Examples:

  - Production application or service source code and configuration

  - Test automation source code and configuration

  - Product or service documentation (including for dev, ops or users)

  - Infrastructure, build, deployment and monitoring code and configuration

**Who can be assessed?**

- Groups from 2 people to thousands can use this framework

- Assessment value is best with a cohesive group, such as a business, and
involving more than 20 people

- Assessment value increases if the assessed group is (or aspires to be)
part of a larger organization of groups and external eco-systems

## Assessment model

Provided questions and indicators are just examples, they are not not intended as a literal "checklist". Meeting all example indicators is not a guarantee of a particular score. Maturity level scoring will be a discussion â€“ if you have good reasons and supporting data for your approach, even if it does not align with this framework, you may still be scoring high for source code strategy.

The generic scoring guidance can be found [here](scores.csv)

## How can you use this framework

While measurement framework emerges, you can get an structured reference to learn what parts of your source code strategy assessment are relevant. You will also find examples of the type questions and indicators you could look as reference to derive a maturity level and subsequently suggestions or ideas on potential improvement actions.
